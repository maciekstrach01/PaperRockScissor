# PaperRockScissor

The aim of the task was to implement the PaperRockScissor game.
The program implements exception handling and when the user enters a non-numeric value an appropriate message will appear, but the program will continue without terminating its operation. To handle the exception when the user enters a number but outside the range 1-3, I have used a conditional instruction with an appropriate message.
The program follows the rules of the game PapierKamieÅ„NoÅ¼yce, and the corresponding implementation according to the rules of this game is written in the conditional instruction if/if else.
